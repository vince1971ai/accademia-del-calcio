### Chapter 1: The Hero's Journey – Gamification as Training

Your journey in the Academy is an epic adventure, modeled on the principles of "gamification" to make learning an engaging and measurable game.

-   **Climb the Ranks of Glory (XP and Levels):** Every challenge you overcome, every correct answer you give, will earn you Experience Points (XP). Accumulate them to level up through 10 degrees of prestige: from a humble **Prospect** (Lvl 1) to a **Recruit**, up to a hardened **Veteran**, a **Master** of strategy, and finally, a **Legend** (Lvl 10) whose name will echo in the history of the Academy. Your progress is always visible in your profile.

-   **Conquer the Seals of Valor (Badges):** Your achievements will not go unnoticed. You will be rewarded with dozens of digital badges that testify to your conquests: complete your first quiz, achieve a streak of consecutive logins, get a perfect score, complete all the tests of a category, or become a tactics expert. Each badge is a piece of your armor.

-   **Complete Missions:** On your Home screen, you will find daily and weekly missions that will guide you, offering clear objectives to earn XP and bonus rewards.
